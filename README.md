# GSuite Email Forwarder Formatter

## About
This script transforms table-formatted emails into a tree-structured, comma-separated list that bypasses GSuite's 12 destination limit per forwarder. Tree is built from the leaves up for a clean and readible list. Written in JavaScript and compatible with Google Sheets. 

Features:
* Ignores duplicate forwarders
* Accepts multiple tables across different sheets
